# Overview
A template for projects built from Electron + Vue + Webpack (eventually also Vuex). As we all know, there are plenty of these around. I made this one because 1) I did not find a good one that combined all three of these platforms (Electron, Vue, Webpack), and I needed one for CheatSheet, 2) so that I could learn to set up Webpack manually, and 3) so that I have an easy template to use for any future projects.

# Usage

```
git clone ...
cd electron-vue-template
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

That will get the project up and running. After that, make changes, then run `npm run build` and `npm start` to see them. Happy coding!

# Included

I hope to include these eventually as well:
